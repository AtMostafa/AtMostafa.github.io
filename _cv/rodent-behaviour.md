Trying to understand rodent behaviour using several motor tasks.

# In my PhD

I trained rats in a task that essentially was a timing task.
On a powered treadmill (just like a treadmill people run on), animals learnt to wait for 7s before approaching the reward that was installed in the front.
Most animals spent those 7 seconds by stereotypically executing a single motor routine.
Observing this (peculiar) behaviour led us to ask two questions:
- Are animals 'able' to time their behaviour without resorting to such motor strategies?
- How is our favourite brain region, the striatum, involved in learning and execution of this routine?

Each question is now addressed in a separate paper.
Following, I will describe how we approached those problems.

## Is timing without moving possible?

It has been long known that animals tend to move when they need to keep track of time.
But, whether they _can_ do it without moving was not clear.
To address this, I designed several behavioural experiments on the treadmill.
To one degree or another, those experiments disfavoured the usage of motor routines.
If animals had an internal (within their brains, regardless of their bodies) sense of time, not finding a motor strategy to fill the 7s interval wouldn't impact their performance.
Long story short, in every and each experiment, timing performance suffered.
We then interpreted these results using the (radical) embodied cognition framework.

## Does the striatum do what it is supposed to do?

Other than purely behavioural experiments, I also performed some lesion surgeries to elucidate the role of the striatum.
Different theories of basal ganglia (and the striatum) function provided different predictions and we set out to test them.
I learnt stereotaxic surgeries in order to infuse neurotoxins in subregions of the striatum.
The principle is simple:
make an incision, do the craniotomy above the striatum, and lower the micro-needle and inject a few hundred nanolitres of a drug which will slowly diffuse and _kill_ the neurons it touches.

In practice however, there is voodoo involved!
It is very difficult to get consistent results.
After experiments were done, we used immunohistochemistry to verify the efficacy of lesions and we realised that the extent and location of the lesion varied substantially.
To overcome that issue, my colleagues and I performed a _huuuge_ number of lesions (>100), and also quantified the volume of the lesion relative to the entire volume of the striatum, by assuming both the lesion and the striatum as truncated cones between consecutive coronal sections.
The image below shows one such section.
