I've been meaning to learn—at least the basics of— machine learning and/or deep learning for a long time.
I think the sheer amount of resources available makes things difficult for beginners.
The one thing that many people suggest is the Andrew Ng's machine learning course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
I had a look, but I preferred a book, rather than videos and I preferred a more direct and speedy approach.

I am already more than comfortable with coding in python and have the basic mathematical understanding for _using_ deep learning techniques.
I don't remember from where/who, but I found this website: [https://d2l.ai/index.html](https://d2l.ai/index.html).
It's an open-source book that covers the basic theories and immediately switches to practice.
What I love is that it is fully implemented in Jupyter Notebooks as well, so I can run the examples in the books while I'm reading it, play with the parameters, skim the documentation and move forward.
I don't run all the examples since I am mostly interested in learning the concepts but still, knowing that they are there when I actually want to train a neural network is great.
