My name is, __surprise surprise__, Mostafa â€”and no, I didn't misspell it, this is how I read and write it.
I had a few free days and I suddenly decided to start this website, but I'm not quiet sure, why, for who, and to publish what.
So, at least for the moment, I'll post stuff instead of the placeholders, and then I may share things I like and/or opinions in the [blog](http://thisismostafa.site/blog) section.

I am an Electrical-Electronics engineer by training.
I changed lanes and did a MSc in Biomedical Engineering, where I was exposed to neuroscience and got seduced by it.
Then, I left my country to do a PhD in neuroscience.
I defended in 2020 and I'll start a postdoc soon.
